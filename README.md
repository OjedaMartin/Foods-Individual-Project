# *Foods - IndividualProject*

## Author: *Martin Ojeda*

### Single Page Application made for Henry Bootcamp using the following technologies: 

- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- Express
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL

In this application i was asked to make a simple page using the Spoonacular API, which has many recipes. I created all kinds of features including sorting, filetering, searching by name and so on. I designed it to have a simple and easy to use style that ended up being friendy to the user

To try the repository all you have to do is copy it and use npm install on the api and client folders. once you do that you can simply use npm start to display the project locally!

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did doing it!
